        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <h3>Are my files and data safe with PDFTree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, your files and data are completely safe. PDFTree processes all your documents directly within your web browser. This means your sensitive files never leave your computer and are never uploaded to our servers. Your data remains 100% private and secure.</p>

        <h3>Why don't my files get uploaded to a server?</h3>
        <p>PDFTree utilizes advanced client-side JavaScript libraries that operate entirely within your browser. This design choice prioritizes your privacy and security by eliminating the need to transfer your files to an external server for processing.</p>

        <h3>What is the maximum file size I can use?</h3>

        <h3>Does the "Merge PDF" feature have a limit on the number of files?</h3>

        <h3>Will my merged PDF maintain the quality of the original files?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the "Merge PDF" feature combines your original PDF files without altering their content or quality.</p>

        <h2>Converting Images to PDF</h2>
        <h3>What image formats are supported?</h3>
        <p>Currently, PDFTree supports JPG and PNG image formats for conversion to PDF.</p>
